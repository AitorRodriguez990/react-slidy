## Overview

React Slidy is a simple and minimal slider component. It was based on the fabulous [lory.js slider](https://github.com/meandmax/lory) altough as the main objective is to achieve the best performance and smoothness a lot of it was rewritten. Also, it's wrapped on a React component in order to be used on projects using ReactJS.

## Browser compatibility

I haven't did a lot of testing on that but it's supposed to work on Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, Edge and IE 11. If not, please, fill an issue.

## Features
* 1:1 slide movement
* Optimized for smoothness and performance
* Lazy Loading for slider and for every slide
* Server rendering compatible
