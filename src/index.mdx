# React Slidy

This component aims to fullfil a basic need for a carousel in React. 1:1 slide, basic transition, mobile first experience and basic stuff for adding and controlling events. It's not meant to be full of options but to achieve 60fps.

**It only has one dependency**: an intersection observer polyfill that will be loaded only if your browser doesn't support it, or if you haven't polyfilled it yet.

**tl;dr: a simple and minimal slider component for React**
