# Examples with anchor wrapping content

import {Fragment, useState} from 'react'
import { Playground, Props } from 'docz'
import ReactSlidy from '../index.js'
import Number from '../examples/Number'
import '../index.scss'

While not recommendable, you could wrap the Slider with a clickable element like an anchor, and the next and previous buttons will work as expected while the rest of the slider is clickable.

<Playground>
  <a href='#'>
    <ReactSlidy>
      <Number num={1} />
      <Number num={2} />
      <Number num={3} />
      <Number num={4} />
    </ReactSlidy>
  </a>
</Playground>
