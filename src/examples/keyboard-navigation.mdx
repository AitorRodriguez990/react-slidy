# Activating keyboard navigation

import {Fragment, useState} from 'react'
import { Playground, Props } from 'docz'
import ReactSlidy from '../index.js'
import Number from '../examples/Number'
import '../index.scss'

Sometimes, specially for slides on fullscreen, you might want to activate the keyboard navigation in order to offer a best experience to the user.

<Playground>
    <ReactSlidy keyboardNavigation>
      <Number num={1} />
      <Number num={2} />
      <Number num={3} />
      <Number num={4} />
    </ReactSlidy>
</Playground>
